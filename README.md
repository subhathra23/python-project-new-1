# python-project-new-1
Usage

To use this project:

Prepare your data: Ensure that you have a dataset containing customer-related data, such as demographics, usage behavior, and churn labels.

Preprocess the data: Use the provided data preprocessing functions or customize them according to your dataset. This may involve handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

Train the models: Utilize various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting, to train predictive models on your preprocessed data.

Evaluate the models: Assess the performance of the trained models using suitable evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Analyze the results to understand the predictive capabilities of each model.

Predict customer churn: Apply the best-performing model to new data to predict customer churn. Use the model's predictions to identify customers at risk of churning and take appropriate retention actions.
